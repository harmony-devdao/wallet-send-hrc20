# Example How To Send HRC-20 Tokens

This is a basic example how you can programatically send HRC-20 tokens.
This example uses **ether-js**.

##  DISCLAIMER
1. **Test your code _rigorously_ before deploying it to mainnet. The DevDAO tries hard to 
keep the examples error free. But errors can always happen. And we take no responsibility when you mindlessly copy this code!**

2. **Don't share/expose your private key to anyone. They will have access to your funds! Store it in the .env file and ensure that it won't be commited to GIT.**

3. **Don't use your own mainnet wallet. Create a separate wallet for this to protect your funds!**
